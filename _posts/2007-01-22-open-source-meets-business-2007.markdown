Today I leave for a two day visit at the [Open Source Meets Business](http://www.heise.de/veranstaltungen/2007/ho_osb/en/)
conference in Nürnberg, where [Christoph](http://wiki.cubic.uni-koeln.de/blog/) will speak about the
[Chemoinformatics OpenSource Initiative](http://chemoinformatics.org/) (COSI). If you happen to go to that meeting too,
let's try to meet!
