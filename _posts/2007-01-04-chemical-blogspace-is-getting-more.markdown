The best remedy for being depressed is the rush after hacking some nice new feature (unfortunately, it is addictive). After
[hacking InChI support into Chemical blogspace](http://chemicalblogspace.blogspot.com/2006/12/hacking-inchi-support-into-cb.html)
a couple of days back, adding some more visual feedback on [those molecules](http://wiki.cubic.uni-koeln.de/cb/inchis.php)
is not that hard, with [PubChem](http://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) around that is:

Beware! Every [marked up molecule](http://chem-bla-ics.blogspot.com/2006/12/including-smiles-cml-and-inchi-in.html) in your
blog is being picked up! So should the compound with the SMILES N(=NC1=CC=C(C=C1)N(CCO)CCO)C3=CC=C(C=CC2=C(C(=C(C#N)C#N)OC2(C)C)C#N)S3,
which is [reported to be the most light sensitive molecule every synthesized so far](http://www.c2w.nl/5792_Organische_chemie_versnelt_internet.lynkx).
