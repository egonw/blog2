[Nascent](http://blogs.nature.com/wp/nascent/2007/02/nature_network_v2_is_live.html) reported that
[Nature Network v2](http://network.nature.com/) has gone life. Never too anxious to try something new,
I created an account and signed in. I even joined two groups: *Bioinformatics* and *Semantic Web for the Life Sciences*.

But, when I tried to create a new group, the system fails. I promised me to send me email for confirmation.
Tried it twice via my [Sourceforge](http://www.sf.net/) email account. No email. I then changed my email
for my Nature account to my Gmail address. Still no email...

I am not located in Boston or London, is that the problem? Is being 'global' not good enough? Is the requirement
to have two 'o's in the name? Cologne then, maybe?

## (Missing) Features

For the rest, the system seems interesting. I am not too fond of having to create accounts all over the place
(*what was the password again???*), but looks promising. The thing I missed most when filling out my profile
was a feature to import the list of my publications from [Connotea](http://www.connotea.org/).

Another thing I missed, was the ability to mention my blog(s) in my profile. May I put this in as request too?
BTW, is there a group or forum on Nature Network where I can file these things?
