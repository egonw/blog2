November last year, I [reported my plans](http://chem-bla-ics.blogspot.com/2005/11/goal-live-chemblaics-cd.html) to develop
a live CD with all our favorite chemo- and bioinformatics software. [Bioclipse](http://www.bioclipse.net/) requires Java5
and sort of still depends on the Sun JVM (I will experiment with classpath-generics later), but is now distributable with
operating systems. So, I made a [Kubuntu](http://www.kubuntu.org/) derived operating system with
[OpenBabel](http://openbabel.sourceforge.net/), [Jmol](http://www.jmol.org/), [PyMOL](http://pymol.sourceforge.net/),
Bioclipse, and, on systems level, the chemical MIMEs and [kfile_chemical](http://www.kde-apps.org/content/show.php?content=28995),
wich extends the desktop with chemistry awareness. In addition, I added the
[Blue Obelisk Data Repository](http://www.blueobelisk.org/), all [CDK News](http://almost.cubic.uni-koeln.de/cdk/cdk_top/cdk_news/)
issues, and the full [NMRShiftDB](http://www.nmrshiftdb.org/) data in CML format.

The [iso image](http://wiki.cubic.uni-koeln.de/iso/cdname.iso) can be downloaded, and is really a first set up. Bioclipse does not
work, but much of the rest does. Please download it (about 625MB) and experiment with it, and leave your comments with this blog item.
