In [the CDK2024](https://chem-bla-ics.linkedchemistry.info/2024/04/07/cdk2024.html)
[grant](https://chem-bla-ics.linkedchemistry.info/2024/05/18/cdk2024-2.html) we wrote about
updating various software projects using the [Chemistry Development Kit](https://cdk.github.io/).
We even wrote that "[r]equired API changes will be publicly shared and disseminated with the
Groovy Cheminformatics with the Chemistry Development Kit book (egonw.github.io/cdkbook/)".
The *Groovy Cheminformatics with the Chemistry Development Kit* book is a project that has
run since 2009.

```git
commit c5cbf9b5dd49baf582afc595c9cbafc714c5199f
Author: Egon Willighagen <egon.willighagen@gmail.com>
Date:   Fri Apr 10 12:34:42 2009 +0200

    Initial copy of the current draft; converted into separate project for easier branching
    for tunes of the book for workshops and sorts
```

The original version was in LaTeX and
[sold online via Lulu.com](https://chem-bla-ics.blogspot.com/2011/02/groovy-cheminformatics.html).
Because all code examples were run (the first public edition had 72 pages with 75 code examples),
like RMarkdown of Jupyter Notebooks by design, I was able to
make [many releases](https://chem-bla-ics.blogspot.com/search?q=lulu).
The big advantage of this was that when [API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API) changes happened,
this would be visible by code not compiling or by output changing.

At some point I open sourced the book (doi:[10.6084/M9.FIGSHARE.2057790.V1](https://doi.org/10.6084/M9.FIGSHARE.2057790.V1))
and then realized that I can [convert the book to Markdown](https://github.com/egonw/cdkbook/commit/2630699aa280200188f2ae9ef3f0698964926752):

```git
commit 2630699aa280200188f2ae9ef3f0698964926752

    Create chapter3.md
```

This is the version available at [egonw.github.io/cdkbook/](https://egonw.github.io/cdkbook/)
for some time now. So, now that for SMARTCyp I need to update the visualization, I went book to my book of
code examples (I have a collection of more than 200 examples), but then found that
the chapter on [Depiction](https://egonw.github.io/cdkbook/depiction) was missing. I was not
looking forward to this, because I know that
the code examples predate a massive improvement by [John Mayfield](https://scholia.toolforge.org/author/Q28796322)
of the rendering stack and I never got around to see if the examples from the book work well enough
with that new API (one is actually updated).

That is when I realized that the *Groovy Cheminformatics* book actually also is a downstream
project that needs updating. I have been doing this already and it's fairly smooth so that I did
not think of including it in the grant, other than updating the
[Migration](https://egonw.github.io/cdkbook/migration) chapter. I now had enough time
to dive into [this project](https://github.com/cdk/nwo-openscience-2024/issues/30). I need that,
because the goal of the project is also to learn about all the meta science aspects of
project maintenance, roles, communication, etc. Therefore also this blog post: we need a track
record, to collect data.

Anyway, porting [the first script](https://egonw.github.io/cdkbook/code/RenderMolecule.code.html) went fairly easy,
but I am now running into a stacktrace:

```
Processing  RenderSelection.groovyin
doing RenderSelection.out ...
org.codehaus.groovy.control.MultipleCompilationErrorsException: startup failed:
/home/egonw/var/Projects/hub/cdkbook-source/code/RenderSelection.groovy: 39: unable to resolve class ExternalHighlightGenerator
 @ line 39, column 16.
   generators.add(new ExternalHighlightGenerator());
                  ^
org.codehaus.groovy.syntax.SyntaxException: unable to resolve class ExternalHighlightGenerator
 @ line 39, column 16.

```

That brings us to the task of how to find where that class is coming from, which happens
to be something I already [had to write up](https://github.com/cdk/nwo-openscience-2024/issues/29)
for up for `RingSearch`. Dependency galore.
