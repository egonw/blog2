The role of a university is manifold. Being a place where people can find knowledge and the track record how that knowledge was reached is
often seen as part of that. Over the past decades universities outsources this role, for example to publishers. This is seeing a lot of
discussion and I am happy to see that the [Dutch Universities](https://www.universiteitenvannederland.nl/) are
[taking back control](/2023/07/06/journal-rankings.html) [fast now](https://www.openaire.eu/next-narcis-dutch-research-portal-on-openaire).
For example, [Radboud University](https://mastodon.social/@Radboud_uni) (>1k followers) already joined the Fediverse (Mastodon etc), making
them independent from non-EU law and commercial interests. Scientific journals, Nobel Prize winners, etc
[already joined too](https://chem-bla-ics.blogspot.com/2022/11/finding-mastodon-accounts-with-wikidata.html), btw.

[This effort](https://netzpolitik.org/2023/a-call-to-action-universities-of-the-world-into-the-fediverse/) is calling for more universities
to go into the direction of open infrastructures. I am looking forward to seeing all Dutch Universities post news on Mastodon, post videos
on PeerTube, etc.

Would it not be awesome if the Fediverse would become the new multidimensional knowledge dissemination and peer review system we have all
been waiting for?
