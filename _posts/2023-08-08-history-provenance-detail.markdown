Just a quick note: I just love the level of detail [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/) allows us to use. One of the marvels is the
practices of `named as`, which can be used in statements for subject and objects. The notion and importance here is that things are
referred to in different ways, and these properties allows us to link the interpretation with the source. For example,
[Max Born](https://scholia.toolforge.org/author/Q58978)'s seminal work *[Zur Quantenmechanik](https://scholia.toolforge.org/work/Q55867811)*
(doi:[10.1007/BF01328531](https://doi.org/10.1007/BF01328531)) uses a very short notation to cite other literature, as footnotes,
and DOIs did not exist yet.

So, in Wikidata, you can [capture this like this](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q55867811#P2860):
