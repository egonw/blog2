[Mitch blogged](http://www.chemicalforums.com/index.php?topic=12307.msg57384#msg57384) about a comment Bethany Halford,
Associate Editor of [C&EN](http://pubs.acs.org/cen/), [left in The Chem Blog](http://www.thechemblog.com/?p=360#comment-1889).
She is writing an opinion piece on chemistry blogs, and is wondering why I blog, whether I use a nickname, and if my
employer knows I blog. So, here goes.

## Why do I blog?

I started blogging [in October 2005 <i class="fa-solid fa-recycle fa-xs"></i>](https://chem-bla-ics.linkedchemistry.info/2005/10/15/chem-bla-ics.html) to reduce my workload:
involved in open source chemoinformatics projects, I quite often emailed to mailing lists about interesting websites/projects/events
etc. Not uncommonly to multiple lists, which required me to tune the email to the list. I realized that blogging about it, would
make it possible to no longer post it to mailing lists, and, therefore, reduce my workload. A second reason is that I post
tricks there, so that I have them available in a central place, and to post questions that, hopefully, others can answer.
As such, it is a way of communicating with fellow scientists, without the need the specifically address them. Open, free and fast.

Deliberately, I did not start a personally diary blog, but a blog about my work as chemoinformatician. Nevertheless, the nature of
blogging allows to give what you write a personal twist. To stress scientific nature of my blog, and many others, is that blogging
scientists often cite and discuss literature, which nicely leads to scientific blog aggregators like [Postgenomic.com](http://postgenomic.com/)
and [Chemical blogspace <i class="fa-solid fa-archive fa-xs"></i>](http://web.archive.org/web/20070115091132/http://wiki.cubic.uni-koeln.de/cb/),
which summarize the scientific literature being discussed in
the blogosphere. The latter even [recently started to blog about molecules being discussed](http://chem-bla-ics.blogspot.com/2007/01/chemical-blogspace-is-getting-more.html).
There are even blogs which specialize on discussing literature, such as [the blog by Rajarshi, Gary and David](http://cheminfoclub.blogspot.com/).

## Why do I not use a nickname?

In my blogging I am clear in who I am, even where I work; I blog about my scientific work, and, as reader, putting one and one
together would lead to my real name soon enough anyway. I did not discuss the blogging with the employer I had in 2005, but the
blogging is mostly done outside office hours anyway, certainly in that period. My current employer is a
[scientific blogger himself <i class="fa-solid fa-archive fa-xs"></i>](https://web.archive.org/web/20070120084645/http://wiki.cubic.uni-koeln.de/blog/index.php).
Even my nickname, or pseudonym, is not that obfuscated.

Moreover, I do make a statement in my blog (which sort of summarizes to: "you cannot do science if you cannot reproduce experimental results"),
and I think it is not more than fair to identify myself. I'm not like Ender's brother [Peter](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Wiggin).

## Why do I answer Bethany's questions?

I try to convince myself that I do not answer these questions out of [procrastination <i class="fa-solid fa-recycle fa-xs"></i>](https://cen.acs.org/articles/84/i22/Power-Procrastination.html),
something Bethany is wondering. Instead, I like blogging as new way to communicate with fellow scientists on a scientific level (Bethany,
please *do* explore [the full chemical blogspace <i class="fa-solid fa-recycle fa-xs"></i>](https://web.archive.org/web/20070607221957/http://wiki.cubic.uni-koeln.de/cb/blogs.php), and be amazed of the high scientific
content gems around!), though this might qualify is catching up with current literature. Moreover, answering this questions allows
me to advertize my blog, and some websites I like. I feel that blogging might fill a niche in scientific communication.

Bethany, please feel free to leave additional questions as comment.
