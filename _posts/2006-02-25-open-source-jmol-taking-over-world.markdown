Earlier I already [reported](2006-02-01-open-source-jmol-hits-student-text.markdown) that student text books were picking up
[Jmol](http://www.jmol.org/) as 3D viewer. Now, [Nature Structural & Molecular Biology](http://www.nature.com/nsmb/index.html) reports
(DOI:[10.1038/nsmb0206-93](https://doi.org/10.1038/nsmb0206-93)) that they picked it up too, using
[FirstGlance in Jmol](http://firstglance.jmol.org/) (thanx Peter, for reporting this on the
[Blue Obelisk](http://blueobelisk.org/) [mailing list](http://hardly.cubic.uni-koeln.de/mailman/listinfo/blue-obelisk)!).
And, thanx Eric, for acknowledging the hard work of the [Jmol developers](http://sourceforge.net/project/memberlist.php?group_id=23629).

An example article in this Nature publication is Crystal structure of the essential N-terminal domain of telomerase reverse transcriptase
by Jacobs et al. (DOI:[10.1038/nsmb1054](http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nsmb1054)) about the structure of a part of the telomerase reverse
transcriptase (FirstGlance: [2B2A](http://molvis.sdsc.edu/fgij/fg.htm?mol=2B2A)). You can easily [google](http://www.google.com/search?q=FirstGlance+site%3Anature.com)
for more articles as they get indexed.

Note that FirstGlance is certainly not the only webinterface using Jmol! An overview of [websites using Jmol](http://wiki.jmol.org/WebsitesUsingJmol)
is found in the [Jmol wiki](http://wiki.jmol.org/). Those who are not convinced yet, please check out [PubMed](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?CMD=search&DB=pubmed)
and search for Jmol there.

And, yes, this makes me a proud Jmol developer!
