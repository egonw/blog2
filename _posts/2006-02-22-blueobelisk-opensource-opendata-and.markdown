OpenSource, OpenData and OpenStandards are not as strong in chemoinformatics as they are in bioinformatcs, where it is common knowledge
that sharing is a good. Today, the [JCIM](http://pubs3.acs.org/acs/journals/toc.page?incoden=jcisd8) published on the web an
[article](http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/ci050400b) about the [Blue Obelisk](http://www.blueobelisk.org/) movement, which promotes these
three idealogies.

Several open source projects participate, amongst which the [CDK](http://cdk.sf.net/), [Jmol](http://www.jmol.org/),
[JOELib](http://joelib.sf.net/), [OpenBabel](http://openbabel.sf.net/), [Chemical Markup Language](http://cml.sf.net/),
[Bioclipse](http://bioclipse.net/) and [Kalzium](http://cdk.sf.net/).
