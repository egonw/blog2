This blog is [almost 18 years old](https://chem-bla-ics.blogspot.com/2005/10/chem-bla-ics.html) now. I have long wanted
to migrate it to a version control system and at the same time have more control over things. Markdown would be awesome.
In the past year, I learned a lot about the power of [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/minima) and needed to get more
experienced with it to use it for more databases, like we now do for [WikiPathways](https://wikipathways.org/).

So, time to [migrate](https://egonw.github.io/blog/) this blog :) This is probably a multiyear project, so feel free to continue
reading it hear. Why? Because I start with the old posts :) Along the way, I am fixing things, improving it. I still
have plenty on my todo list, but already happy with having learned [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/), which makes
it easy to annotate with how I fixed broken links (or not). I now use three icons: a box for when I use the
Internet Archive (they can use your donation); a 'recycle' icon when I found a new URL for the same page; and a
broken URL link for other situations.

This is what it looks like:
