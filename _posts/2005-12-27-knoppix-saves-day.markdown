After the three obligatory days of christmas holidays (fun, especially with two children, but very exhausting), it is time to get back to business again. I'm still
at my father-in-laws place with only XP installed, so booted the [Knoppix 4.0.2 DVD](http://www.knopper.net/knoppix/) I burned last friday. Eclipse is not working,
but being able to use Kmail to read my email again is just what you need as in internet-junkie. A computer is just not complete without a nice KDE session hanging around.

Anyway, booted eclipse on my computer at work, and tunneled the window over SSH. Not overly fast, but it seems to run fine. (If only I knew how to setup NX on
that Kubuntu breezy system!) Let's see if I can get the [CDK bug count](http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=20024&atid=120024) somewhat lower.
